This is based on "Flexible Countdown". The parameter names are not as helpful,
but the problem is essentially identical; don't be thrown off!
Given 4 parameters (param1, param2, param3, param4) print the multiples of param1,
starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal
to param4, then skip (don't print) it. Do this using a WHILE loop.
Given (3, 5, 17, 9), print 6, 12, 15
(which are all multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, and excluding the value 9).
